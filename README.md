  * UCI Boot Camp study materials, videos, and internet resources on MySQL, Node.js, and Inquirer.
  * Jeff Howell and Mike Scharf for the homework walk-through videos (Thanks for putting them together and sharing them in the meeting room. They are a big help!).
  * The grader for my Social Media API assignment, whose comments encouraged me to plow through with my employee tracker app -- an assignment I considered to be one of the hardest and most tedious to do -- and not give up and submit subpar work. The grader also taught me the standard that I should keep when writing my README files. *Thank you!*
